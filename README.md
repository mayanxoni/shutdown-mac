# A dead simple AppleScript to shutdown macOS

### Why?
I recently changed my moved from Windows 10 to macOS Catalina, and started tinkering around its features. One fine day I thought that spending *3 seconds* to shut down using this lame process ðŸ˜‘:
<br />

	ï£¿ â†’ Shut Down... â†’ Shut Down
	
 is so average customer style.
 
 So I decided to spend more time to create a shortcut to do that for me in **1 second** ðŸ˜Ž.
<br />

### How?
Well, this script simply tells the "Finder" app to shutdown ðŸ¤¯. Seriously, just checkout the [shutdown.scpt](https://github.com/mayanxoni/shutdown-mac/blob/bfec1fcef68a243f41f990b7c248e7a511bbf908/shutdown.scpt) file in the code.

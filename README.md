#A dead simple AppleScript to shutdown macOS

### Why?
I recently changed my moved from Windows 10 to macOS Catalina, and started tinkering around its features. One fine day I thought that spending *3 seconds* to shut down using this lame process 😑:
<br />

	 → Shut Down... → Shut Down
	
 is so average customer style.
 
 So I decided to spend more time to create a shortcut to do that for me in **1 second** 😎.
<br />

### How?
Well, this script simply tells the "Finder" app to shutdown 🤯. Seriously, just checkout the shutdown.scpt file in the code.
